# How do I approach designing software?
The new design skills that my work on the project helped me craft were a better understanding of OpenGL. It opened my eyes to different design trminology as well. The design process that I followed for my project to work was following a simple design, and creating the 2D design into a 3D design inside of OpenGL. Tactics from my design approach can be applied in future work by taking the thing I learned about in this course, like transformation, translation, moving shapes in a 3D scene.

# How do I approach developing programs?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
The new development strategeties that I used while working on my 3D scene was being able to access the instructions of the project and follow details in order to implement everything correctly. My approach to developing code throughout the milestones was just to build upon my skillset with each module that was completed. Every milestone acted as a building block for me to hone ach individual skill. Iteration factored into my development by allowing me to compound on my skills.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations gives me the new knowledge ad skills that can be applied n my future educational pathway by giving me the design skillset needed to excell in other courses in my degree. Computational graphics and visualizations gives me the new knowledge ad skills that can be applied n my future professional pathway by giving me the the design skillset that will allow me the opportunity to operate with this skillset in the workplace.
